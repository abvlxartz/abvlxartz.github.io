<h1>Final Project</h1><br>
<p> For my final project I decided to do minimalistic tarot card designs centered on women's issues. 2021 has been a controversial year for women's rights with the ban on abortion in Texas and the perpetual debate over women's rights. The cards I chose are The Star, The Chariot, and The Queen of Cups. The meaning behind The Star is hope, faith, and rejuvenation. I feel like the imagery of menstruation is appropriate because it is a cycle of rejuvenation, a cycle of life and death. The Queen of Cups card means compassion calm, and comfort. For this card I also focussed on menstruation with the hand holding a menstrual cup. While it is a pun menstrual products are not easily accessed among all communities. 64% of women can't afford to buy period products. The affordability of period products is no joke. The Chariot card means direction, controls and willpower. The imagery of the stork, often symbolizing pregnancy, is used in this piece to represent abortion. I feel like it's fitting that the card means control and abortion is something women should have control over whether they decide to get one or not and should not be debated by the law. While the imagery and meaning of the cards correlate, the colors used in the design also reference meaningful colors during the Women's Suffrage Movement: purple representing loyalty and steadfastness; gold/yellow representing light and life, guidance; and green representing hope.  </p>
