<h1>Cyberpunk Themed Art</h1>
<h2>I recently got into designing cyberpunk themed characters. I think the overal aesthetic is super cool!</h2>
<br>

<h3>Apex </h3>
<p>I designed this character on September 14th, his name is Apex. I adore his deign and love the cool glowing effect the glowpen and nebula brush have.I especially love the details on the tail and headgear. </p>

<h3>My First Cyberpunk Design</h3>
<p>This is my first cyberpunk themed character. I totally winged his design and looked at a lot of reference. But I really like how he turned out. He was designed for an art trade.</p>
